## Work Summary

I need to budget 48 hours for the following items:

- [hook] immediate explanation of idea at the title/menu screen (hook) (2-3 hours)
- [mechanic] implementation of circle projection of AABBs (4-6 hours)
- [play] level design (12 hours)
- [emotion] story and character (3 hours)
- [feel] sound (whatever remaining... piano song?)

Total work time expected: 24 hours

### Hook

1. There will be a simple grey eye silhouette that fades from black.
2. The eye-lid opens as a simple black cover sweeps up to reveal eye.
3. The pupil and iris translate down while eye-lid opens.
4. The white circle fades in with the projection colors over it.
5. The eye silhouette fades to black.
6. The level reality fades in with vision cones to each block revealing the nature of the projection.
7. The leve reality fades to black, and the eye silhouette fades back.
8. Repeat fade trading.
7. Draw title bl1nd with "1" and "d" flickering randomly to hint at the 1d nature of the game.
8. Display text below the eye that says press any key to start.
9. Close eye when key pressed and fade to black to initiate blindness.

### Mechanic

1. Create a way to make quick levels (colored AABBs, map walls, starting point)
2. Create a simple projection of AABBs onto a circle which remains fixed at the center of the screen.
3. Resolve technical issues like drawing order and culling.
4. The colors should fade darker to indicate depth.

### Intro

1. Show orange text:

Lori, I know you're scared, but you're not alone.  I'm here for you always.  

I know I can't understand what it's like to be blind.

But I came up with something that might help.  Here-

2. Show white ring flicker on.
3. Fade in orange block.

I know it's not perfect, but it lets you see a single band of color in any
direction.  Can you see me?  I'm in orange.

Here, look _left_ and _right_ to get your bearing.  I'll hold you.

4. Enable left and right controls and wait for player to look around.

Cool, huh?  Haha.

5. Wait for a little bit to let simmer.  Definitely need music to make this work.

Alright, let me run around and clear the room real quick.  Stay here for a second.

6. Wait, and animate the orange person as they move around.  Play sound effect at each way point.

Okay babe, let me highlight the couch blue.  Can you see it?

7. Fade in blue couch on opposite end of room.

Great it works!  Wanna see if you can walk there yourself?

You can move _forward_ (^) and _backward_ (v) without hitting anything.  I've cleared the room.

(I'll stay here so I don't confuse your frame of reference!)

8. Wait for player to touch couch.

YES!

9. Orange runs over to couch. Footsteps.

WE DID IT!  WE'RE THE BEST!

10. Wait for a second.

We should play a game now!  Hide and Seek?
