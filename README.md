This is an experimental 1D game.  It is my entry into Ludum Dare 28 "You only
get one".

## Goal

My intention is to make an experiment to see if a person can interpret a 2D
world with just a 1D image, in a similar way that we can interpret a 3D world
with a 2D image.

I also want to wrap it in an emotionally compelling environment with a dark
atmosphere and emotional story to heighten the gravity and challenge of
blindness.
